# Study-Playlist

This assignment involves first creating a collection of songs. Then, to play through that collection of
songs, you will create different kinds of iterators that step through those songs in different orders.
Through the process of completing this assignment, you will get practice utilizing the Iterator and
Iterable interfaces from the Java API. You will also get practice implementing a doubly linked list, and
doing some algorithm analyses. Although this assignment does not require that you write any test
methods, doing so is highly encouraged to help you gain confidence that your code works as intended.
